    <td>Morning glory plants are easily started by seeds sown directly in the garden after the threat of frost has passed and the soil has warmed up. Indoors, the seeds should be started about 4-6 weeks before the last frost in your area. Since morning glories have relatively hard seed coats, you should soak the seeds in water overnight or nick them before sowing. Sow the seeds of morning glory about ½ inch deep and give them about 8- to 12-inch spacing. Once plants have reached about six inches or so in height, you may want to provide some type of support for the vine to twine around. Those planted in hanging baskets can simply be left to spill over the container’s edge.</td>

Soil Requirements
Bellflowers grow best is loose, well-draining soil with a pH range between 6-8. By creating a planting mixture that is 50% soil and 50% compost you will ensure healthy, long-living plants that will produce an abundance of beautiful flowers for years.
Light Requirements
Bellflowers will tolerate a little shade in the afternoon, but prefer to grow in a location that is in full sun. The more direct sunlight the plant receives, the more blooms it will produce.
Temperature and Humidity Requirements
Warm days and cool nights are ideal for Bellflowers. These plants won’t grow well in regions with hot, tropical climates nor in regions that dip below 50 degrees at night. Bellflowers will develop powdery mildew in humid climates and soils that are kept overly moist.
Watering
Allow soil to feel dry to the touch between waterings. Soil should not be allowed to dry out completely and should never be soggy. Always apply water at soil level to prevent plant foliage from getting wet. Water early in the morning so the rising sun can quickly dry off any moisture that may have gotten on plant stems or foliage.</td>

Soil
Chances are there are more finicky flowers in your garden than the Butterfly Weed, so feel free to allow them to dictate the soil composition—when it comes to this plant, you don't have to stress. Butterfly Weed can prosper in a variety of soil conditions and compositions, from clay to gravel, and generally prefers a neutral to slightly acidic pH.
Water
During its first year of life (or until new plants start showing mature growth), you should maintain a moist soil environment for the Butterfly Weed. Once the plant appears to be well-established, you can cut back to watering it only occasionally, as it now prefers dry soil.
Temperature and Humidity
Because the Butterfly Weed is adaptable to zones three through nine, it can thrive in a variety of different temperature and humidity settings. Generally, the plant emerges in late spring, hitting its peak bloom during the warmer summer months and drying on the stem throughout the autumn and winter. It also tolerates heat and drought well.</td>
