Soil Requirements
Bellflowers grow best is loose, well-draining soil with a pH range between 6-8. By creating a planting mixture that is 50% soil and 50% compost you will ensure healthy, long-living plants that will produce an abundance of beautiful flowers for years.
Light Requirements
Bellflowers will tolerate a little shade in the afternoon, but prefer to grow in a location that is in full sun. The more direct sunlight the plant receives, the more blooms it will produce.
Temperature and Humidity Requirements
Warm days and cool nights are ideal for Bellflowers. These plants won’t grow well in regions with hot, tropical climates nor in regions that dip below 50 degrees at night. Bellflowers will develop powdery mildew in humid climates and soils that are kept overly moist.
Watering
Allow soil to feel dry to the touch between waterings. Soil should not be allowed to dry out completely and should never be soggy. Always apply water at soil level to prevent plant foliage from getting wet. Water early in the morning so the rising sun can quickly dry off any moisture that may have gotten on plant stems or foliage.</td>

Soil
Chances are there are more finicky flowers in your garden than the Butterfly Weed, so feel free to allow them to dictate the soil composition—when it comes to this plant, you don't have to stress. Butterfly Weed can prosper in a variety of soil conditions and compositions, from clay to gravel, and generally prefers a neutral to slightly acidic pH.
Water
During its first year of life (or until new plants start showing mature growth), you should maintain a moist soil environment for the Butterfly Weed. Once the plant appears to be well-established, you can cut back to watering it only occasionally, as it now prefers dry soil.
Temperature and Humidity
Because the Butterfly Weed is adaptable to zones three through nine, it can thrive in a variety of different temperature and humidity settings. Generally, the plant emerges in late spring, hitting its peak bloom during the warmer summer months and drying on the stem throughout the autumn and winter. It also tolerates heat and drought well.</td>

    <td>Dahlia</td>
    <td>Flower</td>
    <td>1. Know Your Tubers
Dahlias sprout from buds that are formed in the fall. These buds are located at the base of the stem, just above the tubers. The tubers themselves do not produce sprouts -- they are food storage vessels that help fuel the plant's early growth.
Dahlias may be purchased two ways: as single tubers with a bud attached or as a clump of tubers around a stem.
2. Timing is Key
If tubers are being planted directly into the garden, wait until the soil has warmed to 60°F. Dahlias will not grow in cold soil and their foliage is sensitive to frost.
In cool climates, dahlias can be planted indoors, 4 to 6 weeks before the last frost date. Fill 1 or 2 gallon pots with moist growing mix. Plant the tuber(s) with the stem or sprouts facing up and cover with 2” of soil. Put the pots in a warm place with good light and water sparingly. Start watering regularly once the plants are several inches tall. Transplant outdoors after danger of frost has passed.
3. Know Where and How to Plant
Dahlias bloom best when they are planted in full sun and fertile, well-drained soil. Border dahlias can be planted 15” apart from center to center; standard types are usually spaced about 18” from center to center.
Loosen the soil to a depth of 12”. Add compost and all-purpose granular fertilizer to the planting area and mix well. Dig a hole and plant the tubers, keeping the stem(s) or sprouts upright. The top of the tubers, where the sprout emerge, should be positioned no more than 1-2” below the soil surface. Backfill the hole with soil.
4. The Value of Pinching and Staking
When the plants are 12” tall, pinch off the top of the main stem. This will stimulate lateral branching and result in more stems and more flowers. For instructions, see HERE.
Border dahlias are self-supporting, but full size dahlias can grow 3 to 4 feet tall and benefit from being staked or caged. Read about staking options HERE.
5. Watering and Fertilizing
Dahlias grow best when they receive a consistent supply of water. Drip irrigation is ideal, as it directs moisture to the root zone while keeping the foliage dry. If you are hand-watering, it's best to water deeply once per week. Mulching around the base of the plants will help reduce moisture loss and keep the roots cooler.
There are many schools of thought about fertilizing dahlias. Some say they are heavy feeders. Other say there's no reason to fertilize. Everyone does seem to agree that dahlias grow best in fertile soil that contains lots of organic matter. Before planting each spring, cover the area with 3-4" of rotted manure or compost and dig it into the top 12".
As a general rule, we recommend treating dahlias as you would a tomato plant. Apply an all-purpose 5-5-5 fertilzer at planting time and when they start blooming, feed them once or twice a month with a low nitrogen liquid fertilizer. If you plan to save the tubers, they will store better if you stop fertilizing by early September.
6. Controlling Insects and Disease
Protect bees, butterflies and other pollinators by avoiding the use of chemical pesticides and herbicides.
To discourage disease, keep dahlia foliage as dry as possible. Water deeply once or twice a week, allowing the top inch of soil dry out in between. Clip off the bottom 12” of foliage to encourage good air circulation.
Slugs and snails love eating young dahlia foliage. Sluggo Plus is an effective organic control when it is applied early and refreshed often. It is sprinkled on the soil surface, so is not a danger to pollinators. Earwigs are another troublesome dahlia pest. Like slugs and snails, they prefer cool, moist conditions and can damage buds, flowers and foliage. Minimize their damage by keeping the area around your dahlias clear of spent flowers and foliage. Also, if you avoid using leaves or straw as mulch, you will give earwigs fewer places to hide and breed.
7. Be Generous
Dahlias are among the world’s best cut flowers and it takes just a few stems to make an impressive bouquet. Harvesting flowers is good for the plants and encourages them to continue flowering month after month. So cut often and share generously! Delight family and friends, neighbors and coworkers with the beauty of homegrown dahlias.
8. Deadhead Regularly
Removing flowers that have passed their prime keeps plants looking neat, encourages them to produce new buds and helps control pests and disease. If you're in a hurry, simply nip off the flower heads. Otherwise, use scissors or pruning shears to cut the spent flowers back to a main stem. This will help to stimulate new growth and encourage longer stems that are better for cutting.</td>

You can leave summer and spring snowflake bulbs in the ground in the same location for many years unless you want to divide them for propagation purposes. The plants don’t require regular division. They spread to fill the space between the plants, but never become invasive.</td>

    <td>Apples grow in Zones 3 to 9. Some can tolerate winter temperatures as low as -40°F. Choose an apple tree suited for winter temperatures where you live. See Chilling Hours below.
Apples generally do not grow well close to the ocean where temperatures remain moderate most of the year.
Apples grow best in full sun. An apple tree planted in partial sunlight will not bear as many fruits like an apple planted in full sun.
Apples grow best in well-drained loamy soil, although they will grow in more sandy soil or in soil with some clay.
Apples grow best in a neutral soil pH of 6.0 to 7.0.
Plant apples sheltered from a prevailing wind or breeze. Avoid planting apples in a low spot where cold air or frost can settle.
Late spring frosts can kill apple flowers. Apples bloom in late spring after peaches, cherries, and almonds. Early fall frosts can damage the fruit. Choose a variety suited to your growing region.
Avoid planting in the same spot where apple trees have previously grown. Pests and diseases that attack apple trees may still live in the soil.
Apples have chilling requirements or chilling hour requirements. This is the number of hours at 45°F (7°C) or less than the cultivar or variety requires each winter in order to flower and leaf out in the in spring. Chilling hours can vary from 1,000 or more to as few as 400 hours.
It is important to choose an apple variety with chilling hours suited to your climate and winter temperatures.

    <td>Maze</td>
    <td>Vegetable</td>
    <td>These are somewhat on a larger scale for most gardeners to handle, but a good labyrinth or maze garden doesn’t have to be tall or expensive to construct. How to Make a Garden Maze The first step in making a garden maze or labyrinth is to design it. This is not the kind of garden you can make on the fly. Get out pen and paper, or a computer program, and draw your garden based on the dimensions in the space you have available. Then it’s just a matter of putting in plants or other garden materials according to your design. Here are some garden maze and labyrinth ideas to help get you started in planning and designing: Patio labyrinth. Use pavers of two different colors to create a labyrinth and a patio in one. Pavers and turf. Another use for pavers is to lay out a maze or labyrinth within grassy turf. The grass becomes the path for the maze, while the pavers act as the edges. Alternatively, the pavers or flat rocks can be used as the pathway and the turn as the edges. Meadow maze. A simple way to create a maze is simply to mow it into a lawn. To get more height and maintain simplicity, let the grass around the maze grow into a meadow with tall grasses and pretty wildflowers. Hedge maze. This is the classic garden maze. Dense, slow-growing shrubs, like yews, are often used to create true mazes, but it costs a lot. Vine maze. To create a real maze with height, but without the expense of using all hedges, try climbing vines. You’ll need to construct the maze out of a climbing structure for the vines, like wire fencing. Hops, grapes, clematis, and honeysuckle are good choices. Ornamental grass labyrinth. A labyrinth laid out in a variety of ornamental grasses is pretty and requires little maintenance.</td>
