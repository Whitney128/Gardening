## Gardening

Collaborated with a group of three. Liz, Julie and myself.

This website was created to help people find the best plants for them depending on what they are looking for from answering 6 questions. 

You can choose from State, Season, Plant Type,Sun Needs, Soil Needs and features.

You can also hover over the graphs under the visuals page and find a plant name, plant type and season by hovering the graph. The map allows for a more big picture examples for plants that would thrive in your state.

Under our data page we further explain how we broke down the data after webscraping and creating a decision tree to map out the options and give an output with an event listner.
